Note: The use of the word tone, both for a sound and for the interval between two sounds or tones, is confusing, but is common -- almost universal. Note: Nearly every musical sound is composite, consisting of several simultaneous tones having different rates of vibration according to fixed laws, which depend upon the nature of the vibrating body and the mode of excitation. The components (of a composite sound) are called partial tones; that one having the lowest rate of vibration is the fundamental tone, and the other partial tones are called harmonics, or overtones. The vibration ratios of the partial tones composing any sound are expressed by all, or by a part, of the numbers in the series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.; and the quality of any sound (the tone color) is due in part to the presence or absence of overtones as represented in this series, and in part to the greater or less intensity of those present as compared with the fundamental tone and with one another. Resultant tones, combination tones, summation tones, difference tones, Tartini\'s tones (terms only in part synonymous) are produced by the simultaneous sounding of two or more primary (simple or composite) tones. 5.

The alternate rising and falling of the waters of the ocean, and of bays, rivers, etc., connected therewith. The tide ebbs and flows twice in each lunar day, or the space of a little more than twenty- four hours. It is occasioned by the attraction of the sun and moon (the influence of the latter being three times that of the former), acting unequally on the waters in different parts of the earth, thus disturbing their equilibrium. A high tide upon one side of the earth is accompanied by a high tide upon the opposite side. Hence, when the sun and moon are in conjunction or opposition, as at new moon and full moon, their action is such as to produce a greater than the usual tide, called the spring tide, as represented in the cut. When the moon is in the first or third quarter, the sun\'s attraction in part counteracts the effect of the moon\'s attraction, thus producing under the moon a smaller tide than usual, called the neap tide. Note: The flow or rising of the water is called flood tide, and the reflux, ebb tide. 3.

Vaguely and ambitiously extravagant in speculation, imagery, or diction.

Such, in the better sense of the term, is the transcendental philosophy, or transcendentalism. Each of these words is also used in a bad sense, empiricism applying to that one-sided view of knowledge which neglects or loses sight of the truths or principles referred to above, and trusts to experience alone; transcendentalism, to the opposite extreme, which, in its deprecation of experience, loses sight of the relations which facts and phenomena sustain to principles, and hence to a kind of philosophy, or a use of language, which is vague, obscure, fantastic, or extravagant.\\n\\nA transcendentalist.

Note: Type are mostly made by casting type metal in a mold, though some of the larger sizes are made from maple, mahogany, or boxwood. In the cut, a is the body; b, the face, or part from which the impression is taken; c, the shoulder, or top of the body; d, the nick (sometimes two or more are made), designed to assist the compositor in distinguishing the bottom of the face from the top; e, the groove made in the process of finishing, -- each type as cast having attached to the bottom of the body a jet, or small piece of metal (formed by the surplus metal poured into the mold), which, when broken off, leaves a roughness that requires to be removed. The fine lines at the top and bottom of a letter are technically called ceriphs, and when part of the face projects over the body, as in the letter f, the projection is called a kern. The type which compose an ordinary book font consist of Roman CAPITALS, small capitals, and lower-case letters, and Italic CAPITALS and lower-case letters, with accompanying figures, points, and reference marks, -- in all about two hundred characters.

Besides the ordinary Roman and Italic, some of the most important of the varieties are -- Old English. Black Letter. Old Style. French Elzevir. Boldface. Antique. Clarendon. Gothic. Typewriter.

The smallest body in common use is diamond; then follow in order of size, pearl, agate, nonpareil, minion, brevier, bourgeois (or two-line diamond), long primer (or two-line pearl), small pica (or two-line agate), pica (or two-line nonpareil), English (or two-line minion), Columbian (or two- line brevier), great primer (two-line bourgeois), paragon (or two- line long primer), double small pica (or two-line small pica), double pica (or two-line pica), double English (or two-line English), double great primer (or two-line great primer), double paragon (or two-line paragon), canon (or two-line double pica).

Brilliant . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Diamond . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Pearl . . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Agate . . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Nonpareil . . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Minion . . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Brevier . . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Bourgeois . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Long primer . . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Small pica . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Pica . . . . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz English . . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Columbian . . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Great primer . . . abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz The foregoing account is conformed to the designations made use of by American type founders, but is substantially correct for England. Agate, however, is called ruby, in England, where, also, a size intermediate between nonpareil and minion is employed, called emerald. Point system of type bodies (Type Founding), a system adopted by the type founders of the United States by which the various sizes of type have been so modified and changed that each size bears an exact proportional relation to every other size. The system is a modification of a French system, and is based on the pica body. This pica body is divided into twelfths, which are termed \\"points,\\" and every type body consist of a given number of these points. Many of the type founders indicate the new sizes of type by the number of points, and the old names are gradually being done away with. By the point system type founders cast type of a uniform size and height, whereas formerly fonts of pica or other type made by different founders would often vary slightly so that they could not be used together. There are no type in actual use corresponding to the smaller theoretical sizes of the point system. In some cases, as in that of ruby, the term used designates a different size from that heretofore so called. 1 American 9 Bourgeois | | 1| 2 Saxon 10 Long Primer | | 2| 3 Brilliant 11 Small Pica | | 3| | 4 Excelsior | 4| | 5 Pearl 16 Columbian | | 5| 6 Nonpareil 18 Great Primer | | 7 Minion | 8 Brevier 20 Paragon | | Diagram of the \\"points\\" by which sizes of Type are graduated in the \\"Point System\\".

Those intended for black tea are spread out in the air for some time after being gathered, and then tossed about with the hands until they become soft and flaccid, when they are roasted for a few minutes, and rolled, and having then been exposed to the air for a few hours in a soft and moist state, are finally dried slowly over a charcoal fire. The operation of roasting and rolling is sometimes repeated several times, until the leaves have become of the proper color. The principal sorts of green tea are Twankay, the poorest kind; Hyson skin, the refuse of Hyson; Hyson, Imperial, and Gunpowder, fine varieties; and Young Hyson, a choice kind made from young leaves gathered early in the spring. Those of black tea are Bohea, the poorest kind; Congou; Oolong; Souchong, one of the finest varieties; and Pekoe, a fine-flavored kind, made chiefly from young spring buds.

Those), that usually points out, or refers to, a person or thing previously mentioned, or supposed to be understood. That, as a demonstrative, may precede the noun to which it refers; as, that which he has said is true; those in the basket are good apples. The early fame of Gratian was equal to that of the most celebrated princes. Gibbon. Note: That may refer to an entire sentence or paragraph, and not merely to a word.

And when Moses heard that, he was content. Lev. x. 20. I will know your business, Harry, that I will. Shak. Note: That is often used in opposition to this, or by way of distinction, and in such cases this, like the Latin hic and French ceci, generally refers to that which is nearer, and that, like Latin ille and French cela, to that which is more remote. When they refer to foreign words or phrases, this generally refers to the latter, and that to the former. Two principles in human nature reign; Self-love, to urge, and Reason, to restrain; Nor this a good, nor that a bad we call. Pope. If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this or that. James iv. 16. 2. As an adjective, that has the same demonstrative force as the pronoun, but is followed by a noun. It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city. Matt. x. 15. The woman was made whole from that hour. Matt. ix. 22. Note: That was formerly sometimes used with the force of the article the, especially in the phrases that one, that other, which were subsequently corrupted into th\'tone, th\'tother (now written t\'other). Upon a day out riden knightes two . . . That one of them came home, that other not. Chaucer. 3. As a relative pronoun, that is equivalent to who or which, serving to point out, and make definite, a person or thing spoken of, or alluded to, before, and may be either singular or plural. He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame. Prov. ix. 7. A judgment that is equal and impartial must incline to the greater probabilities. Bp. Wilkins. Note: If the relative clause simply conveys an additional idea, and is not properly explanatory or restrictive, who or which (rarely that) is employed; as, the king that (or who) rules well is generally popular; Victoria, who (not that) rules well, enjoys the confidence of her subjects. Ambiguity may in some cases be avoided in the use of that (which is restrictive) instead of who or which, likely to be understood in a co\xf6rdinating sense. Bain. That was formerly used for that which, as what is now; but such use is now archaic. We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen. John iii. 11. That I have done it is thyself to wite [blame]. Chaucer. That, as a relative pronoun, cannot be governed by a preposition preceding it, but may be governed by one at the end of the sentence which it commences. The ship that somebody was sailing in. Sir W. Scott. In Old English, that was often used with the demonstratives he, his, him, etc., and the two together had the force of a relative pronoun; thus, that he = who; that his = whose; that him = whom. I saw to-day a corpse yborn to church That now on Monday last I saw him wirche [work]. Chaucer. Formerly, that was used, where we now commonly use which, as a relative pronoun with the demonstrative pronoun that as its antecedent. That that dieth, let it die; and that that is to cut off, let it be cut off. Zech. xi. 9. 4. As a conjunction, that retains much of its force as a demonstrative pronoun. It is used, specifically: -- (a) To introduce a clause employed as the object of the preceding verb, or as the subject or predicate nominative of a verb. She tells them \'t is a causeless fantasy, And childish error, that they are afraid. Shak. I have shewed before, that a mere possibility to the contrary, can by no means hinder a thing from being highly credible. Bp. Wilkins. (b) To introduce, a reason or cause; -- equivalent to for that, in that, for the reason that, because. He does hear me; And that he does, I weep. Shak. (c) To introduce a purpose; -- usually followed by may, or might, and frequently preceded by so, in order, to the end, etc. These things I say, that ye might be saved. John v. 34. To the end that he may prolong his days. Deut. xvii. 20. (d) To introduce a consequence, result, or effect; -- usually preceded by so or such, sometimes by that. The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings. Milton. He gazed so long That both his eyes were dazzled. Tennyson. (e) To introduce a clause denoting time; -- equivalent to in which time, at which time, when. So wept Duessa until eventide, That shining lamps in Jove\'s high course were lit. Spenser. Is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice Shak. (f) In an elliptical sentence to introduce a dependent sentence expressing a wish, or a cause of surprise, indignation, or the like. Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that this knight and I have seen! Shak. O God, that right should thus overcome might! Shak. Note: That was formerly added to other conjunctions or to adverbs to make them emphatic. To try if that our own be ours or no. Shak. That is sometimes used to connect a clause with a preceding conjunction on which it depends. When he had carried Rome and that we looked For no less spoil than glory. Shak. 5. As adverb: To such a degree; so; as, he was that frightened he could say nothing. [Archaic or in illiteral use.] All that, everything of that kind; all that sort.

The necessary variations in the electrical currents are usually produced by means of a microphone attached to a thin diaphragm upon which the voice acts, and are intensified by means of an induction coil. In the magnetic telephone, or magneto-telephone, the diaphragm is of soft iron placed close to the pole of a magnet upon which is wound a coil of fine wire, and its vibrations produce corresponding vibrable currents in the wire by induction. The mechanical, or string, telephone is a device in which the voice or sound causes vibrations in a thin diaphragm, which are directly transmitted along a wire or string connecting it to a similar diaphragm at the remote station, thus reproducing the sound.

Achromatic telescope. See under Achromatic. -- Aplanatic telescope, a telescope having an aplanatic eyepiece. -- Astronomical telescope, a telescope which has a simple eyepiece so constructed or used as not to reverse the image formed by the object glass, and consequently exhibits objects inverted, which is not a hindrance in astronomical observations. -- Cassegrainian telescope, a reflecting telescope invented by Cassegrain, which differs from the Gregorian only in having the secondary speculum convex instead of concave, and placed nearer the large speculum.

See under Gregorian. -- Herschelian telescope, a reflecting telescope of the form invented by Sir William Herschel, in which only one speculum is employed, by means of which an image of the object is formed near one side of the open end of the tube, and to this the eyeglass is applied directly. -- Newtonian telescope, a form of reflecting telescope. See under Newtonian. -- Photographic telescope, a telescope specially constructed to make photographs of the heavenly bodies. -- Prism telescope. See Teinoscope. -- Reflecting telescope, a telescope in which the image is formed by a speculum or mirror (or usually by two speculums, a large one at the lower end of the telescope, and the smaller one near the open end) instead of an object glass.

The rest of the year was called vacation. But this division has been practically abolished by the Judicature Acts of 1873, 1875, which provide for the more convenient arrangement of the terms and vacations. In the United States, the terms to be observed by the tribunals of justice are prescribed by the statutes of Congress and of the several States. 6. (Logic)  The subject or the predicate of a proposition; one of the three component parts of a syllogism, each one of which is used twice. The subject and predicate of a proposition are, after Aristotle, together called its terms or extremes. Sir W. Hamilton. Note: The predicate of the conclusion is called the major term, because it is the most general, and the subject of the conclusion is called the minor term, because it is less general. These are called the extermes; and the third term, introduced as a common measure between them, is called the mean or middle term. Thus in the following syllogism, --Every vegetable is combustible; Every tree is a vegetable; Therefore every tree is combustible, -combustible, the predicate of the conclusion, is the major term; tree is the minor term; vegetable is the middle term. 7. A word or expression; specifically, one that has a precisely limited meaning in certain relations and uses, or is peculiar to a science, art, profession, or the like; as, a technical term. \\"Terms quaint of law.\\" Chaucer.

Syn. -- Limit; bound; boundary; condition; stipulation; word; expression. -- Term, Word. These are more frequently interchanged than almost any other vocables that occur of the language. There is, however, a difference between them which is worthy of being kept in mind. Word is generic; it denotes an utterance which represents or expresses our thoughts and feelings. Term originally denoted one of the two essential members of a proposition in logic, and hence signifies a word of specific meaning, and applicable to a definite class of objects. Thus, we may speak of a scientific or a technical term, and of stating things in distinct terms. Thus we say, \\"the term minister literally denotes servant;\\" \\"an exact definition of terms is essential to clearness of thought;\\" \\"no term of reproach can sufficiently express my indignation;\\" \\"every art has its peculiar and distinctive terms,\\" etc. So also we say, \\"purity of style depends on the choice of words, and precision of style on a clear understanding of the terms used.\\" Term is chiefly applied to verbs, nouns, and adjectives, these being capable of standing as terms in a logical proposition; while prepositions and conjunctions, which can never be so employed, are rarely spoken of as terms, but simply as words.\\n\\nTo apply a term to; to name; to call; to denominate.

In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of application, to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and neuter or passive verbs with a following noun which limits their action. Its sphere verges upon that of for, but it contains less the idea of design or appropriation; as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience; let us keep this seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste; an event painful to the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a dislike to spirituous liquor. Marks and points out each man of us to slaughter. B. Jonson. Whilst they, distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. Shak. Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. 2 Pet. i. 5,6,7. I have a king\'s oath to the contrary. Shak. Numbers were crowded to death. Clarendon. Fate and the dooming gods are deaf to tears. Dryden. Go, buckle to the law. Dryden. 4.

But it has come to be the almost constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it has no prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct object or subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to die for one\'s country is noble, i.e., the dying for one\'s country. Where the infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage formerly allowed the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out for see (Matt. xi. 8). Then longen folk to go on pilgrimages, And palmers for to seeken strange stranders. Chaucer. Note: Such usage is now obsolete or illiterate. In colloquial usage, to often stands for, and supplies, an infinitive already mentioned; thus, he commands me to go with him, but I do not wish to. 5. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to has a pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically. Thus, it denotes or implies: (a) Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as far as; as, they met us to the number of three hundred. We ready are to try our fortunes To the last man. Shak. Few of the Esquimaux can count to ten. Quant. Rev.

(d) Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste; she has a husband to her mind. He to God\'s image, she to his was made. Dryden. (e) Comparison; as, three is to nine as nine is to twenty-seven; it is ten to one that you will offend him. All that they did was piety to this. B. Jonson. (f) Addition; union; accumulation.

[In this sense archaic] \\"I have a king here to my flatterer.\\" Shak. Made his masters and others . . . to consider him to a little wonder. Walton. Note: To in to-day, to-night, and to-morrow has the sense or force of for or on; for, or on, (this) day, for, or on, (this) night, for, or on, (the) morrow. To-day, to-night, to-morrow may be considered as compounds, and usually as adverbs; but they are sometimes used as nouns; as, to-day is ours. To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow; Creeps in this petty pace from day to day. Shak. To and again, to and fro. [R.] -- To and fro, forward and back. In this phrase, to is adverbial.
